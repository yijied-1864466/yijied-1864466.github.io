        <p class = "roundcornered" id="para1">Land Base Aerial Support (abbreviated as LBAS) is a system introduced in the May 2nd-3rd 2016 update along with the Spring 2016 Event, which enables seaplane, carrier-based, and land-based aircraft (but not Autogyro/Liaison Aircraft) to be launched from an air base to assist the fleet during sortie in certain maps.<q>http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Land_Base_Aerial_Support</q></p>

        <p>Each aircraft has their own "flight range", which indicates the combat radius of the aircraft. Aircraft that have low flight range will not be able to reach map nodes that are too far away from their air base. In most cases, land-based bombers have greater combat radius than carrier-based aircraft. <q>http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Land_Base_Aerial_Support</q></p>

      <p class = "roundcornered" id="para2"> <img id = "margined-floated-img" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kancolle/images/7/7a/BoukuuResultMessage1.png">When the system was first implemented on May 3rd, 2016, there was a bug that caused the bombing damage from land-base aerial support to be omitted from internal enemy HP damage calculation, which occasionally causes a supposedly sunk enemy unit to be able to act as if they were alive (able to attack/be targeted by your fleet). Two days after the system's implementation, an emergency update was deployed to fix the performance of land-base attack aircraft. <q>http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Land_Base_Aerial_Support</q></p>
